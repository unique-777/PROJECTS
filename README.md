It includes perfect statistical analysis, feature engineering,hyperparameter tuning  and model tuning for optimal performance. The system ensures efficient fraud detection by leveraging machine learning for real-world applications. 
2.Weather Forecasting using Machine Learning
This project predicts weather conditions using AutoKeras and Random Forest, leveraging past weather data for accurate forecasting. It applies machine learning and statistical analysis to improve prediction reliability.
3.Mental Health Data Analysis: A Comparative Study of Apriori and Eclat Algorithms.This project applies Apriori and Eclat algorithms to mental health data to form itemsets and demonstrate their differences.Code and results are provided to illustrate the comparative analysis of these two frequent pattern mining algorithms.
4.Quantum Federated Learning for Healthcare:
Developed an AutoML and H2O.ai project for Quantum Federated Learning, enhancing security and efficiency in healthcare AI. This model enables privacy-preserving, distributed learning across hospitals without sharing sensitive patient data. It improves medical predictions and diagnostics while ensuring data security.
5.HHO web page:here in this i have done perfect website with collection of webpages but not backend due to having no images respected for this i did not install in this so the basic page is from basic.html so check it out 
6.here medicine.zip is my new project which is done by taking openfda as an API to predict prices and brands of a medicines which is having a same drug using django and deep learning along with some part of ML...7.Explorix – Smart AI Travel Assistant--A real-time AI-powered travel assistant that provides weather updates, safety scoring, scam alerts, and personalized recommendations.Built with NLP and Machine Learning, it helps travelers make informed and safer decisions effortlessly.please check it out...
